# Logos

The Landcare logo is a powerful symbol that represents the identity and values of the Landcare movement. Its consistent use strengthens the brand's recognition and ensures clarity in all communications.

## Logo Structure
The Landcare logo is composed of three key elements:
1. **The Identifier ("Caring Hands")**: The "Caring Hands" symbol is the visual identifier of Landcare. It represents unity, support, and care for the environment.
2. **The Group Name (Optional)**: Customised logos may include a group name beneath the identifier to personalise the logo for specific regions or initiatives.
3. **The Wordmark ("Landcare")**: The "Landcare" wordmark establishes the organisation’s name and ties it to the caring hands symbol.

### Example Structure
```text
+-----------------------+
|    Caring Hands       | (Primary Visual Element)
+-----------------------+
|   [Group Name]        | (Optional Customisation)
+-----------------------+
|      Landcare         | (Wordmark)
+-----------------------+
```

The primary Landcare logo includes the "Caring Hands" symbol and the "Landcare" wordmark. This version is used for most applications and represents the entire organisation.
