# Logos

The Landcare logo is a powerful symbol that represents the identity and values of the Landcare movement. Its consistent use strengthens the brand's recognition and ensures clarity in all communications.

## Logo Structure
The Landcare logo is composed of three key elements:
1. **The Identifier ("Caring Hands")**: The "Caring Hands" symbol is the visual identifier of Landcare. It represents unity, support, and care for the environment.
2. **The Group Name (Optional)**: Customised logos include a group name beneath the identifier to personalise the logo for specific regions or initiatives.
3. **The Wordmark ("Landcare")**: The "Landcare" wordmark establishes the organisation’s name and ties it to the caring hands symbol.
4. **Container (Framing Box)**: A framing box with a distinctive "dog-ear" diagonal cut at the bottom, unifying the identifier, group name, and wordmark into a cohesive and recognisable design.
