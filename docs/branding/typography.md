# Typography

This page demonstrates the typography styles defined in the design system.

## Primary Typefaces:
### Sari Family
For titles, headings and visually important copy.
Regular | **Bold**

**Sari** is the distinctive ‘Landcare’ logotype. It can be used for titles, headings and any visually important text. Sari is a classic serif font that creates a solid foundation for the lively, vibrant elements of our branding.

### Open Sans Family
For body copy, headings, sub-headings and captions.
Regular | Regular Italic | Semi Bold | Semi Bold Italic | Bold | Bold Italic | Extra Bold | Extra Bold Italic

**Open Sans** is used for all body copy, headings, sub-headings and captions. Open Sans is an adpatable and highly legible typeface and is available in a variety of weights for both print and digital applications. It is also available as a [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans).

## Secondary Typeface:
### Futura PT Family
For alternative design options
Book | Book Italic | Medium | Medium Italic | Heavy | Heavy Italic | Bold | Bold Italic

**Futura** is available as a secondary typeface as an alternative to Open Sans to supplement design options.

### Calibri Family
For Windows applications and when Open Sans is unavailable.
Regular | Regular Italic | Bold | Bold Italic

When Open Sans is unavailable for digital applications, Calibri can be used as a substitute secondary typeface. Calibri bold, regular or light should be used as a substitute in applications that require system typefaces such as Powerpoint, Word, Excel, outlook and emails as well as any Microsoft Office applications.
